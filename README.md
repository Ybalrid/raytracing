# Used resources

Some of the maths implemented here came directly from the `Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics - Third Edition` book. The interesction code and camera ray shooting are based on the explainantions from the [Scratch Pixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/index.php?redirect) website. Same with the auto-blocking "shadow acne" problem solution (adding some bias on the sadow ray).
